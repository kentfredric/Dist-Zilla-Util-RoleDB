A list of things that must be manually require()d for the module to exist.
Note: This should not be needed for anything, as its really only intended
as a way to make hidden packages require()able.
Usually, this will be exactly one item, and it will be the same as the modules name.

=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Util::RoleDB::Entry - Extracted meta-data about a role

=head1 VERSION

version 0.003002

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Dist::Zilla::Util::RoleDB::Entry;
    my $entry = Dist::Zilla::Util::RoleDB::Entry->new(
        name => "-FileGatherer",
        description => "A thing that adds files to your dist"
    );

=head1 METHODS

=head2 is_phase

Returns false

=head2 C<require_module>

Load the module itself.

Usually, this just amounts to requiring C<full_name>, but it might not be
in the case somebody has manually modified C<required_modules>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<name>

Contains the short name for the role, in a form acceptable by C<Dist::Zilla>'s C<plugins_with> method.

e.g:

    -FileGatherer

Because

    zilla->plugins_with(-FileGatherer)

=head2 C<full_name>

Contains the fully qualified version of the role.

For instance, when C<name> is C<-FileGatherer>, C<full_name> will be C<Dist::Zilla::Role::FileGatherer>

=head2 C<required_modules>

This contains an C<ArrayRef> of Modules that are required if one ever intends to use the module in C<full_name>.

Note, that this is not intended to be really used. It only exists as a helper in the event one wishes to document
a roles existence in a file other than one matching its name.

For example:

    Foo.pm:

        package Foo;

        use Moose::Role;

        package Bar;

        use Moose::Role;

In such a scenario, one cannot get Bar without C<require Foo>

So here,

    ->new( name => 'Foo' ); # required_modules is automatically [Foo]
    ->new( name => 'Bar', required_modules => ['Foo'] );

Also, if a role has peculiar load order requirements ( like seen in Class::MOP ) that means
certain other libraries must be C<require>'d before C<require>ing the module itself, this would be a convenient place to put such information.

This mechanism is mostly to support C<< $entry->require_module >>

=head2 C<description>

Contains a textual description of the Role.

Usually, a copy of the Roles "ABSTRACT" will do the trick.

=head2 C<deprecated>

If a role is deprecated, setting this may be useful.
