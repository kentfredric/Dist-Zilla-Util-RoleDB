=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility is a hard-coded list of various known C<Dist::Zilla> roles and their properties.

It's not generally usable by most people, and is more useful for query tools, such as

  dzil dumpphases

Certain entries may have additional markers indicating they are C<phase> roles,
and will have relevant data indicating what methods are invoked in that C<phase>.
